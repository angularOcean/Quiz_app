# Trivia Quiz Game in Typescript

![](https://github.com/angularOcean/Quiz_app/blob/master/screenshot_1.JPG)

This project is a trivia game built with Typescript, React, and the [Open Trivia Database] (https://opentdb.com/) as a way to practice Typescript as well as working with React. 


## Description

The trivia game currently defaults to 10 random questions drawn from all topics available from the Open Trivia Database.

## Features Under Construction

The options page has not been fully implemented and so the settings to change number of questions, difficulty, and topic will not work at this time.

## Requirements

You must have node.js installed

## Running the Quiz App

Download the repository into a folder on your computer. In the project directory, you can run the following commands: 

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
